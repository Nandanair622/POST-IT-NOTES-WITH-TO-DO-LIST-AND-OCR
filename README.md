# <strong><em>POST IT NOTES WITH TO-DO LIST AND OCR </em></strong>
## <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
<p>A Post-it Note (or sticky note) is a small piece of paper with a re-adherable strip of glue on its back, made for temporarily attaching notes to documents and other surfaces. A low-tack pressure-sensitive adhesive allows the notes to be easily attached, removed, and even re-posted elsewhere without leaving residue. Our project idea is similar,we are going to turn this into a web application using python. With the post-it note app, people can now jot things down anywhere without the fear of forgetting things or misplacing the notes, which is a real possibility with physical notes. Along with this, we also have a feature for the To-Do list wherein you can add your daily tasks and an Image Text converter where Text can be extracted from any image.<br></p>

## <strong>Problem Statement</strong><br>
While comparing with apps online like Mi notes, it is found that the deleted notes cannot be retrieved back, but Stickies offer a solution. Many apps that were surveyed did not have a priority feature that gives desktop notifications after certain periods repeated which results in the user forgetting the task. On surveying a group of young learners, it was found that while taking notes, students tend to take pictures but later want to store them in the form of text. 

## <strong>Objectives of project</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>To fulfill the purpose of post-it notes paperlessly.</li>
<li>To make the notes accessible from anywhere through the internet.</li>
<li>To provide timed desktop notifications through a toggle for each note.</li>
<li>Image-to-Text Converter.</li>
<li>To create a to-do list for the day.</li>
</ul>
